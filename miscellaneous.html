					<h4><b><i> “The nature of yoga is to shine the light of awareness into the darkest corners of the body.”</i></b></h4> <br>
                    <h2 class="text-center"><b> Corona with Lord Krishna’s Karuna</b></h2> <br> <br>
                    <h3>Why there are Pandemics like Corona ?</h3> <br>
                    <p> 1. Law of material world – it’s a temporary place of miseries. <br>
                        2. To remind us that our real permanent home is not this world but the spiritual world. <br>
                        3. Punishment by mother nature for various harms caused by men like that of a 
                        mother’s punishment to naughty child. <br>
                        4. Mass Karma – Nature’s way of punishing in mass.</p> <br>
                <h3>This situation of crisis and fear can be turned into a great opportunity by keeping the 
                    right attitude of taking shelter of God as seen in history.
                    </h3> <br>
                    <p>1) Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra – surrendered to Krishna – heard spiritual 
                        knowledge – became free from illusions and fears – Bhagavad Gita originated <br>
                          i. By understanding spiritual knowledge and learning our spiritual duties, we can 
                        become free from fear & illusions. <br>
                        2) King Parikshit – got cursed to die in 7 days – devoted himself in just hearing & 
                        remembering about God – Great Srimad Bhagavatam came into existence <br>
                        i. Most important duty in life is to cultivate remembrance of God <br>
                        ii. Death – final exam, Test is whether we are able to remember God at that time. <br>
                        3) Gautama Buddha – brought in royal palace away from all worldly miseries – on visit 
                        to kingdom – came across realities of death, old age, diseases – decided to begin 
                        spiritual journey to explore about our true identity – realized spiritual dimension of 
                        life <br>
                        i. No material achievements will accompany us after death <br>
                        ii. Only our spiritual investments – Devotion and service to God – our true wealth 
                        which never gets destroyed. <br>
                        iii. Story of Alexander – asked for 3 things after his death.  <br>
                        ▪ Body to be carried by best doctors ( No one can save us except God) <br>
                        ▪ Distribute his wealth ( No one can take one’s riches with himself) <br>
                        ▪ Keep his hands open in grave ( we come empty handed and we leave  
                        empty handed)</p> <br>

                        <h3>Important things for application in our lives :</h3> <br>
                        <p>1) Work upon improving the quality of life. What matters is the quality of life not 
                            quantity. Many trees are living for thousands of years but their existence has no 
                            meaning. Proper quality of life : Life based upon the spiritual principles : Chanting 
                            God’s names, following God’s instructions, working for the ultimate aim of life – God 
                            realization and going back to Godhead. <br>
                            2) Take to the real vaccine – which can protect us from all material problems of life for 
                            all time to come which are :  <br>
                            a. Chanting of Holy Names of God : Hare Krishna Mahamantra <br>
                            b. Aligning our life as per God’s desires as expressed in scriptures like Bhagavad 
                            Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam etc. <br>
                            c. Keeping Good company in our life <br>
                            d. Following A – Association, B – Books , C – Chanting, D – Diet of Prasad, E –
                            service to God <br>
                            3) Devotee of Lord do not fear death because :  <br>
                            a. He has broad vision of life – Soul is not destroyed – moves to destination based 
                            upon previous actions <br>
                            b. He has full trust in God’s plan - God always takes care of His devotee like a 
                            father always cares for his son. <br>
                            c. Knows that God is always there to take us towards the right destination if we 
                            are sincerely trying to live as per God’s desires. <br>
                            d. A coward dies many times but a brave dies only once. <br>
                            e. He spends his life in loving and serving God as well serving God’s children –
                            all humanity. E.g :  <br>
                            i. Jesus – sacrificed to spread god’s message – prayed for even the 
                            crucifiers. <br>
                            ii. Swami Prabhupad – in old age travelled to US, preached all over the 
                            world – spent whole life spreading spiritual knowledge around the 
                            globe</p> <br>
                            <h3>Some positive transformations brought by Corona :
                            </h3> <br>
                            <p>1) Many have stopped animal killing for the sake of meat eating by becoming to 
                                vegetarians. <br>
                                2) Indians have better Job opportunities as many companied are switching from 
                                China to India – India emerging as Manufacturing hub. <br>
                                3) Many people are turning towards spirituality and God to find out answers to 
                                questions of life</p><br> <br>

                                <h4><i>“When you do pranayama, 80 percent of the toxins in our body are released through the outgoing breath. The regular practice of Kapal Bhati pranayama detoxifies all the systems in our body. And the obvious sign of a healthy body is a shining forehead"</i></h4> <br>

                                <h5>If we connect ourselves to Krishna’s's consciousness, we can get rid of this worldly pandemic and many more diseases. For keeping ourselves healthy and free, will we have to practice Krishna consciousness under the guidance of an appropriate teacher
                                    because everything in this world is temporary after some time that vanishes.
                                    We should not fear these worldly worries because Lord Krishna is standing with us.
                                    
                                    For pleasing Krishna and also pleasing ourselves, keep chanting hare Krishna maha-mantra. Along
                                    with vaccination, chanting is equally important.
                                    and vaccination and chanting 'Hare Krishna' will keep us cure in this situation.</h5> <br><br>
